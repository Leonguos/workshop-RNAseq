# Travel Information

**Travel with Ume책 city buses:**  
Pay your bus ticket on the bus (credit card only), or in advance in the ticket machines at Vasaplan or Ume책 Airport, or at any Reseinfo centre. It is cheaper to buy the ticket in advance. You can also use the app "Ultra vill mer".
Please see tabussen.nu for more information and timetables. You can also choose "Planera resa" and search the addresses as written below:

From **Vasaplan** (Bus 2,5,8,9) to **Universum** (Campus) 6-7 min
  

**Airport bus:**  
The airport bus (Bus 80) goes from the airport to Vasaplan (the city centre), and then passes NUS and Ume책 Campus on the way back. The trip takes about 8 min from the airport to Vasaplan, and about 15 min the other way. It stops at Universum (Ume책 Campus) approx. 5 min after leaving Vasaplan.
