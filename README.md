# workshop-RNAseq [![travis-build](https://travis-ci.com/NBISweden/workshop-RNAseq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/NBISweden/workshop-RNAseq)

This repo contains the course material for NBIS **Workshop on RNA-Seq**. The rendered view of this repo is available [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-RNAseq/).

## Repo organisation

The 3-day course source material is located on the *master* branch (default). The 2-day course material is located on the *twoday* branch. The rendered material is located on the *gh-pages* branch. For most part, one only needs to update content in master. Changes pushed to the *master* or *twoday* branches are automatically rendered to the *gh-pages* branch.

**For more detailed description of repo organisation, files and how it work, see the [template repo](https://github.com/NBISweden/workshop-template-rmd).**

```

git push origin
```

If you are not added as a collaborator, first fork this repo to your account, then clone it locally, make changes, commit, push to your repo, then submit a pull request to this repo.

**It is recommended that you do not push changes too frequently.**

## Rendering

The website is automatically rendered by Travis-CI whenever a change is pushed. **DO NOT** push any rendered material such as `slide_topic.html`, `lab_topic.html` or supporting directories `slide_topic_files`, `lab_topic_files` etc to GitHub.

For local rendering, run `rmarkdown::render_site()` in the project directory. This renders all Rmd and md files to generate the HTML files and all other necessary files (including the assets, images and data directories) and moves them into a directory specified under `output_dir` in **`_site.yml`**. Open `output_dir/index.html` to start. Remove this directory after use. **DO NOT** commit and push this output directory to GitHub.

You can also run `rmarkdown::render("bla.Rmd")` on individual Rmd/md files. This is a time-saver as the whole website need not be rendered just to preview this one file.
